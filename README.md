# Greenhouse Telemetry

_Some code experimenting with greenhouse telemetry and featured in my  [Greenhouse blog series](https://dev.to/rossdrew/technology-choices-in-monitoring-a-greenhouse-2ppf)_

![Grafana Screenshot Sample](./img/Week.png?raw=true)

## Controller

- Rasberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2 
- Programmed in Python (may change later)

## Progress

 Using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/x3CKANNx/gh-telemetry) to keep track of work

## Temp/Humidity

We are using the [AM2302](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/Digital+humidity+and+temperature+sensor+AM2302.pdf) wired as follows

```
VCC -> Pi Pin 1
GND -> Pi Pin 6
DATA -> Pi Pin 7
``` 

and the [Adafruit Python Drivers](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT) which can be set up as follows

(1) Clone the drivers repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT.git
cd Adafruit_Python_DHT
```

(2) Make sure python is up to date
```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
```

(3) Install the Adafruit drivers
```bash
sudo python setup.py install
```

(4) Run the test to make sure it worked
```bash
cd examples
sudo ./AdafruitDHT.py 2302 4
```

## Local Temp/Humidity

Local weather data is retrieved from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API and recorded to DB for each reading for comparison.

## Recording

Data is recorded to a local InfluxDB 

#### Sample Weather JSON Data

```json
{
	"coord": {
		"lon": -0,
		"lat": 0
	},
	"weather": [
		{
			"id": 500,
			"main": "Rain",
			"description": "light rain",
			"icon": "10d"
		}
	],
	"base": "stations",
	"main": {
		"temp": 10.49,
		"pressure": 1014,
		"humidity": 66,
		"temp_min": 8,
		"temp_max": 12.22
	},
	"visibility": 10000,
	"wind": {
		"speed": 3.1,
		"deg": 240
	},
	"clouds": {
		"all": 75
	},
	"dt": 1559121266,
	"sys": {
		"type": 1,
		"id": 1442,
		"message": 0.0063,
		"country": "GB",
		"sunrise": 1559101162,
		"sunset": 1559162573
	},
	"timezone": 3600,
	"id": 1,
	"name": "Location",
	"cod": 1
}
```

## Setup

##### Install [InfluxDB](https://gist.github.com/boseji/bb71910d43283a1b84ab200bcce43c26): 

```bash
curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -
lsb_release -a
```

And with the Linux release codename

```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/debian <CODENAME> stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install influxdb
```

##### Start InfluxDD

```bash
sudo service influxdb start
```

or automatically run on startup

```bash
sudo systemctl enable influxdb
```

##### Install [Grafana](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-grafana/)

```bash
wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana_6.6.0_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i grafana_6.6.0_armhf.deb
```

##### Start Grafana

```bash
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
```
 
or automatically run on startup
 
```bash
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```

Should be running on <server>:3000

##### Setup a Python environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Developing / Debugging

Install sshfs, link development machine to Pi by mounting the source directory and open in development environment

```bash
dnf install sshfs
mkdir /mnt/pi/gh
sshfs pi@<PI_IP>:/mnt/pi/gh /home/src/pi/gh
```

## Running

### Setup config

You will need to fill config.properties with

```
[Deploy]
name = "my deployment name"

[AM2302]
pin = <pin thhat AM2302 is attached to>

[Weather]
location = <location for querying>
open_weather_map_app_id = <your personal app.id>
```

### Setup Database

Delete and recreate a new InfluxDb database

```bash
python init_db.py
```

### Running Telemetry

Run the peripheral read loop

```bash
python read_cycle.py
```

which will start to fill up a specified InfluxDB

Running in a test environment (not on a Raspberry Pi with a AM2302 sensor) will require swapping out the used of `TestClimateDataSource` for the `AM2302DataSource`.  I'm yet to figure out a nice way to automate this.

### Experimental Control

There's a simple control cycle in place in run_greenhouse.py.  This will turn a light on during daylight hours and keep track of soil moisture.  It also has the ability to turn on water which hasn't been included in the cycle quite yet.


## Plans

- Add power generation and usage monitoring
- Add light sensors, window state/control and perhaps automated watering
- Add camera
